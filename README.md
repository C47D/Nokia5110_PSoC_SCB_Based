# PSoC 4 Nokia5110 Custom Component

Custom Component for Nokia5110 displays, this component is based on SPI peripheral, this version is a SCB based SPI on PSoC 4 devices and there´s also UDB based SPI on both PSoC 4 and PSoC 5LP devices.
SCB based have some glitches on the /SS line, this need more work but at the moment the component is usefull.
Internal driver of the Nokia5110 display works at 4MHz so SPI must work at that freq. aswell.

Improvements are welcome.

PSoC Rocks!
